      <h2>Who Is Jesus?</h2>
      <p>Jesus is not just a historical figure, He is the Son of God, the Savior, the King, and the only way to eternal life. He came to earth to live a perfect life and die for our sins, He rose again to conquer death, and He is coming back soon, just as He promised.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>He came to earth to live a perfect life and die for our sins.</li>
        <li>He rose again to conquer death.</li>
        <li>He is coming back soon, just as He promised.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>He Satisfied God’s Justice:</strong> He willingly endured the punishment we deserved.</li>
        <li><strong>He Demonstrated God’s Love:</strong> The cross is the greatest proof of God’s love for us.</li>
        <li><strong>He Defeated Satan and Death:</strong> Through His resurrection, He broke the power of sin and death.</li>

    <section id="repentance" class="section">
      <h2>Repentance — Turning Back to God</h2>
      <p><strong>What Is Repentance?</strong> Repentance means turning away from sin and turning toward God. It’s a heart change that leads to new life.</p>
      <p><strong>Why Repent?</strong> Everyone sins, and sin separates us from God. Without repentance, we remain apart from Him. “All have sinned and fall short of God’s glory.” — Romans 3:23</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Admit you need God.</li>
        <li>Feel sorrow for your sins.</li>
        <li>Confess your sins honestly.</li>
        <li>Decide to turn from sin and follow God.</li>
        <li>Believe Jesus died and rose for you.</li>
        <li>Commit to living for Jesus every day.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>“Repent and be baptized, every one of you.” — Acts 2:38</em></p>

    <section id="prayer" class="section">
      <h2>Prayer — Speaking with the Father</h2>
      <p>Prayer is our way to connect with God—honest, personal, and powerful. We pray to bring needs to God, seek forgiveness, find peace and guidance, and praise Him.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pray in all circumstances:</strong> James 5:13</li>
        <li><strong>Prayer brings healing:</strong> James 5:14</li>
        <li><strong>The power of righteous prayer:</strong> James 5:16</li>
        <li><strong>Confess and pray for one another:</strong> James 5:16</li>
        <li><strong>Prayer changes circumstances:</strong> James 5:17–18</li>

      <h2>The God We Serve — The Holy Trinity</h2>
      <p>We worship one God revealed in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Father is Creator and Sustainer.</li>
        <li>The Son, Jesus Christ, is God incarnate who saves us.</li>
        <li>The Holy Spirit guides, comforts, and empowers believers.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="love" class="section">
      <h2>Living in Love</h2>
      <p>Jesus commands us to love as He loved us, selflessly and completely. Love is the evidence of our faith and how we impact the world. “Let all that you do be done in love.” — 1 Corinthians 16:14; John 13:34</p>
    </section>

    <section id="share" class="section">
      <h2>Why We Share the Gospel</h2>
      <p>We share because we’ve been loved and saved and want others to know hope and freedom in Jesus. “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations.” — Matthew 28:19</p>
    </section>

    <section id="return" class="section">
      <h2>Ready for His Return</h2>
      <p>Jesus promised He is coming back soon. Until then, we live in His love and truth, sharing hope with everyone.</p>
